Francesco Yates, set for release on Friday, September 11th. \n\nSampling the 2003 Baby Bash single ‘Suga Suga’, Schulz’ ’Sugar’  is pure summer; with a smooth groove, softly bouncing beat and silky vocals from Canadian singer songwriter Francesco Yates. Enlisted for remix duty, EDX  layers punchy percussion over an intensified beat and the result is an irresistible dance floor hit with all the charm and groove of the original. \n\nIt’s clear from this latest offering that Italian/Swiss producer EDX is showing no signs of slowing down - with quality release after quality release, a Beatport chart topper under his belt this year with his remix of Sons of Maria and Nora en Pure’s ‘Uruguay’, the uber hit remix for Sam Feldt’s \"Show Me Love\" still growing into summer biggest anthem and a rigorous touring schedule that sees him playing at high profile nightclubs and major festivals around the globe. \n\nBeatport: TBA\nItunes pre-order: https://goo.gl/O10Yut\nYoutube Video Robin Schulz - Teaser: https://goo.gl/CMBt4c","username":"EDX","media":"/tracks/soundcloud:tracks:222238653/streams/https"},{"id":"soundcloud:tracks:6846149","title":"Rainy Streets (\"The Break of Dawn\" VINYL coming in April!)","image":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000058124025-q80daa-t300x300.jpg","duration":155572,"description":"facebook: http://www.facebook.com/blue.in.green.music\n\nVINYL:http://coldbusted.org/vinyl-blue-in-green-the-break-of-dawn/","username":"Blue In Green","media":"/tracks/soundcloud:tracks:6846149/streams/https"},{"id":"soundcloud:tracks:271711406","title":"Cheat Codes & Dante Klein - Let Me Hold You (Turn Me On)","image":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000169718124-vlxtzl-t300x300.jpg","duration":162496,"description":"After smashing worldwide charts with 'Sex', Cheat Codes now proudly present 'Let Me Hold You (Turn Me On) together with Dante Klein.\n\nOut now: https://spinninrecords.lnk.to/letmeholdyou\n\nFollow Cheat Codes:\nhttp://cheatcodesmusic.com/\nhttps://twitter.com/CheatCodesMusic\nhttps://www.facebook.com/cheatcodesmusic\nhttps://instagram.com/cheatcodesmusic/\n\nFollow Dante Klein:\nhttps://twitter.com/dantekleindj\nhttps://www.instagram.com/dantekleinmusic/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/dantekleinmusic/\nhttps://soundcloud.com/danteklein","username":"Spinnin' Records","media":"/tracks/soundcloud:tracks:271711406/streams/https"},{"id":"soundcloud:tracks:253192554","title":"Englishman In New York","image":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-UgL9ymsLD7cK-0-t300x300.jpg","duration":267311,"username":"Sting","media":"/tracks/soundcloud:tracks:253192554/streams/https"},{"id":"soundcloud:tracks:225537832","title":"Already Gone","image":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000130691472-mm6cgx-t300x300.jpg","duration":240870,"description":"","username":"Sleeping At Last","media":"/tracks/soundcloud:tracks:225537832/streams/https"},{"id":"soundcloud:tracks:40032550","title":"To Build a Home","image":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000020080234-j28hu4-t300x300.jpg","duration":364729,"description":"Song originally by The Cinematic Orchestra w/ Patrick Watson \nCover version performed, recorded by Andrew Gavin Williams ","username":"andrew gavin williams","media":"/tracks/soundcloud:tracks:40032550/streams/https"},{"id":"soundcloud:tracks:130363831","title":"Daft Punk - Giorgio by Moroder (Random Access Memories)","image":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000068444735-5gpjcp-t300x300.jpg","duration":544833,"description":"Daft Punk - Giorgio by Moroder (featuring Giorgio Moroder)\r\nfrom the Grammy award winning Platinum album 'Random Access Memories', 2013\r\n\r\nwww.daftpunk.com\r\nwww.giorgiomoroder.com\r\nwww.facebook.com/daftpunk\r\nwww.facebook.com/GiorgioMoroderOfficial\r\nwww.twitter.com/giorgiomoroder\r\nwww.columbiarecords.com\r\n\r\nMy name is Giovanni Giorgio, but everybody calls me Giorgio.","username":"GiorgioMoroder","media":"/tracks/soundcloud:tracks:130363831/streams/https"},{"id":"soundcloud:tracks:3089374","title":"It's Oh So Quiet","image":"","duration":219799,"description":"","username":"rossie","media":"/tracks/soundcloud:tracks:3089374/streams/https"},{"id":"soundcloud:tracks:23483165","title":"Addicted","image":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000011647440-ah7rxh-t300x300.jpg","duration":235843,"description":"Prince Royce makes his English debut with his new single \"Addicted\"!","username":"Atlantic Records","media":"/tracks/soundcloud:tracks:23483165/streams/https"},{"id":"soundcloud:tracks:62311528","title":"Candyman","image":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000031605763-v2rsnq-t300x300.jpg","duration":278177,"description":"I DARE YOU TO SAY HIS NAME FIVE TIMES!\r\n(original song by Philip Glass shout out to him)","username":"Djub","media":"/tracks/soundcloud:tracks:62311528/streams/https"},{"id":"soundcloud:tracks:81073238","title":"Frank Ocean - \"Super Rich Kids\" (feat.
