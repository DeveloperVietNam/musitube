He says that the hype surrounding this EP “is something I’ve never experienced before...and it always get a great reaction”.\n\nOn Along Came Polly, Rebūke showcases his innate ability to craft a weirdly, wonderful slice of techno. On the B-side, Rolo is a much housier affair, weaving together a bouncier bassline and sultry vocal stab.\n\nThe alias of Reuben Keeney, Rebūke, has only been in business for a short while, but his efforts have already proved to be fruitful. He has garnered support from the likes of Nic Fanciulli and released on labels including Saved and DFTD, as well as having a successful club night under his belt, where highly regarded names such as Camelphat, Darius Syrossian, Ejeca and Huxley have all played.\n\nTRACK LISTING\nA.
