In the US, aided by an iPod commercial featuring the song, and presence on the latest successful \"Now\" compilation, \"Feel Good Inc.\" took Gorillaz to a whole new level - the track peaked just outside the top 10 in the Billboard Top 100, and it was also top of the Modern Rock charts for a 3 week spell. In the UK, due to a loophole in the chart rules, Feel Good Inc was able to enter the charts before its official release because the record company released 300 copies of the 7-inch single format, meaning that legal downloads would count towards a chart placing for the single ( this was because, according to UK chart rules at that time, a single could only chart if a physical format was available, although download sales contributed to chart placings). A total of 4 new and original songs were available across formats, although \"Murdoc is God\" was only included on the Japanese CD. The feel of the B-sides was more free and experimental than that of those that had appeared on 'Demon Days' - showcasing another side to the Gorillaz sound. Also, \"Feel Good Inc.\" makes an appearance in Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party 3 on Wii And Grand Theft Auto 5 On Xbox One, Playstaion 4 And PC Versions.","username":"Everything Gorillaz - P2","media":"/tracks/soundcloud:tracks:231321623/streams/https"},{"id":"soundcloud:tracks:218748144","title":"FREE DOWNLOAD: Mark Tarmonea - Clocks [BIACS 001]","image":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000421105974-nfeg5c-t300x300.jpg","duration":206072,"description":"FREE DOWNLOAD: hypeddit.com/track/mvoz7p\n\nFollow Mark Tarmonea: https://soundcloud.com/marktarmonea\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/marktarmonea\n\nThe versatile, exceptional artist Mark Tarmonea returns this year with a new label and new sound. \nAnalogue synthesisers, repetitive techno sequences and his empathic voice transform this timeless classic into a modern and highly addictive masterpiece.

A huge smash initially in the UK, where it remained in the charts for months and the top 10 for weeks. At around the same time radio in Europe also went mad for the song. Slightly later in 2001 the song would also become a massive radio hit in the US and central and South America. Bigger than his previous smash, Song 2 (with Blur), this song remains Damon Albarn's biggest hit. In the UK the Ed Case Refix (available on all formats) actually got far more airplay than the A-side, probably resulting in the inclusion of said remix on the debut LP. B-side Dracula was probably the best of the off cuts from the 'Gorillaz' sessions, and tour rap group Phi Life Cypher also contributed a version.","username":"Everything Gorillaz - P1","media":"/tracks/soundcloud:tracks:231155880/streams/https"},{"id":"soundcloud:tracks:273203206","title":"Dani California","image":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-AEmJa6yXvCe6-0-t300x300.jpg","duration":283089,"username":"Red Hot Chili Peppers","media":"/tracks/soundcloud:tracks:273203206/streams/https"},{"id":"soundcloud:tracks:275869874","title":"Martin Garrix & Bebe Rexha - In The Name Of Love","image":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000173856749-yd3we5-t300x300.jpg","duration":198888,"description":"Finally, my new single 'In The Name Of Love' together with Bebe Rexha is here!\n\nSpotify - http://stmpd.co/sITNOL\niTunes - http://stmpd.co/iITNOL\nApple Music - http://stmpd.co/amITNOL\nGoogle Play - http://stmpd.co/gpITNOL\nAmazon - http://stmpd.co/aITNOL\n\nFollow Martijn ||\nFacebook: facebook.com/martingarrix\nInstagram: instagram.com/martingarrix\nTwitter: twitter.com/martingarrix\nYouTube: youtube.com/martingarrix\nSnapchat: @martingarrix\n\nFollow Bebe Rexha ||\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/beberexha\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/beberexha\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/beberexha\nYouTube: http://youtube.com/beberexha\nSnapchat: @beberexha\n\nFollow STMPD RCRDS || \nFacebook: http://facebook.com/stmpdrcrds\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/stmpdrcrds\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/stmpdrcds\nYouTube: http://youtube.com/stmpdrcrds\nSoundcloud: @stmpdrcrds","username":"Martin Garrix","media":"/tracks/soundcloud:tracks:275869874/streams/https"},{"id":"soundcloud:tracks:165824843","title":"I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor","image":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000089807457-frc3np-t300x300.jpg","duration":293330,"description":"I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor live from madison square garden","username":"Arctic Monkeys","media":"/tracks/soundcloud:tracks:165824843/streams/https"},{"id":"soundcloud:tracks:92507677","title":"The Strokes - Reptilia","image":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000068467051-2bhat6-t300x300.jpg","duration":214746,"description":"Cover by Pineapple Express recorded at Decibel Institute: \nVocals, Rythm Gtr - Bryan Isaac Venegas\nBass - Isaac Nerio\nGuitar - Gerardo Zavala\nDrums - Jose Luis Paredes\nRecording -  Roberto Villalvir \nMix - Juan Ordoñez\n\nSend me a message if you are interested in recording a cover song like this, or better yet, your own music.\n\nAll credits to original composer. \n","username":"Juan Pablo Ordonez","media":"/tracks/soundcloud:tracks:92507677/streams/https"},{"id":"soundcloud:tracks:220647780","title":"Iris","image":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-9VNN5YIuHya5-0-t300x300.jpg","duration":289646,"username":"Goo Goo Dolls","media":"/tracks/soundcloud:tracks:220647780/streams/https"},{"id":"soundcloud:tracks:56526687","title":"Blink 182 - All The Small Things","image":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000275124272-umtm7b-t300x300.jpg","duration":171793,"description":"","username":"HappyHourband","media":"/tracks/soundcloud:tracks:56526687/streams/https"},{"id":"soundcloud:tracks:55211451","title":"REM - Losing My Religion","image":"","duration":284763,"description":"","username":"roxana_styx","media":"/tracks/soundcloud:tracks:55211451/streams/https"},{"id":"soundcloud:tracks:15273221","title":"Foo Fighters - The Pretender","image":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-myT8bW3jICbFqG8B-MLOxJw-t300x300.jpg","duration":269555,"description":"","username":"Foo Fighters","media":"/tracks/soundcloud:tracks:15273221/streams/https"},{"id":"soundcloud:tracks:258954379","title":"Heart-Shaped Box","image":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-5WIMqlPEEvaL-0-t300x300.jpg","duration":279223,"username":"Nirvana","media":"/tracks/soundcloud:tracks:258954379/streams/https"},{"id":"soundcloud:tracks:337047684","title":"Where Is My Mind","image":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000237484652-3404au-t300x300.jpg","duration":223916,"description":"Make sure to follow me ,,, new album coming this summer!","username":"ｄｉｒｅｗｏｌｆｅ 狼","media":"/tracks/soundcloud:tracks:337047684/streams/https"}]}
