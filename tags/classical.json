He played piano on Lauryn Hill's \"Everything Is Everything\" and might as well be considered Kanye West's sidekick, having assisted the producer and MC on several sessions — Jay-Z's \"Encore\" and Slum Village's \"Selfish\" being two of the more prominent 2004 singles featuring his work. A former choir director, he has also released a handful of energetic live discs, some of which are credited to his less hubristic birth name, John Stephens. And though he claims \"I've got something new,\" you've also heard substantial chunks of Get Lifted in records made decades ago by Sly & the Family Stone, Curtis Mayfield, Quincy Jones, and Bill Withers. This might not be a problem for listeners who crave anything that recalls the music they first heard in their youth, but Legend's over-reliance upon his inspirations is an impediment as much as a slick way to grab attention. That's because he has more than enough talent and charm to get by on his own. His own lyrics and hooks are unique and clever enough to get the point across that he's no everyday R&B artist and, just as importantly, he has a personable and instantly fetching voice you could listen to all day long. However, the association with West — whose Sony-distributed boutique label released the record — is very helpful. Without it, Legend would likely be zoned into neo-soul (2003's Live at SOB's New York City really makes this notion apparent), thereby standing little chance of reaching the ears of anyone younger than 30. The production work supporting his songs strikes a fine balance between soul and hip-hop, allowing him to appeal to those who are coming from either angle. This is a very good record. It's a given that Legend is destined to make at least two others that top it.

The work is more commonly known by the title Eine kleine Nachtmusik. The German title means \"a little serenade\", though it is often rendered more literally but less accurately as \"a little night music\". The work is written for a chamber ensemble of two violins, viola, and cello with optional double bass, but is often performed by string orchestras.","username":"Cristiano Ronaldo","media":"/tracks/soundcloud:tracks:11592716/streams/https"},{"id":"soundcloud:tracks:665080826","title":"Small Memory","image":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000659277200-n5wpnb-t300x300.jpg","duration":142119,"description":"","username":"Yoheii","media":"/tracks/soundcloud:tracks:665080826/streams/https"},{"id":"soundcloud:tracks:182206704","title":"The Seven Deadly Sins - Netsujou No Spectrum [Full Opening]","image":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000100701446-54yzxj-t300x300.jpg","duration":208893,"description":"I don't own rights to this music","username":"MARS","media":"/tracks/soundcloud:tracks:182206704/streams/https"},{"id":"soundcloud:tracks:24767003","title":"Erik Satie - Gymnopedie no.1 - Study Music, Work Music, Relaxing Piano Music","image":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-mfaj344vyD4dckfz-C3yvXQ-t300x300.jpg","duration":226698,"description":"","username":"Nicholas Smith","media":"/tracks/soundcloud:tracks:24767003/streams/https"},{"id":"soundcloud:tracks:47356633","title":"I Giorni - Ludovico Einaudi","image":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000023838246-eg8wvp-t300x300.jpg","duration":352186,"description":"Recorded 23/05/2012","username":"James Wickens","media":"/tracks/soundcloud:tracks:47356633/streams/https"},{"id":"soundcloud:tracks:93859013","title":"Arvo Pärt - Spiegel Im Spiegel (Mirror in Mirror)","image":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000048945841-f3i27x-t300x300.jpg","duration":636115,"description":"Album : Alina \r\nGravity soundtrack.","username":"Anas II","media":"/tracks/soundcloud:tracks:93859013/streams/https"}]}
